# description
In Farming.ts, add support for circumstantialSpoilage -- essentially a bunch of ways crops can spoil based on chance per day, with additional stipulations
# notes
Ideas
- infestation: random, but if one is spoilt they all have a chance of spoiling
- livestock trampling: chance x number of livestock
